                            <h4>Zika Virus: Origins and Pathological Actions</h4>
                            <p class = "text text-sm">Zika virus is another vector-borne disease which, like dengue, is spread by Aedes mosquitoes. A. aegypti and A. albopictus are its main vectors. It has come into international focus since the zika virus epidemic of 2015-16. The virus is named after Zika Forest in Uganda, where the virus was first identified in 1947.</p>
                            <p class = "text text-sm">This infection is asymptomatic in three out of four cases. The symptoms which are generally mild can include fever, rash, conjunctivitis, muscle and joint pain, headache and fatigue. While the incubation period of the disease is 3-14 days long, the symptoms last for 2-7 days. </p>

                            <h4>Malaria: Symptoms, Prevention and Cure</h4>
                            <p class = "text text-sm">Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease transmitted by the Anopheles mosquito. It can also spread through blood transfusion though this is rare. Four parasitic species which cause Malaria are P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale and P. malariae. P. falciparum is the deadliest of them, followed by P. vivax. </p>
                            <p class = "text text-sm">Symptoms commonly appear 10-15 days after the mosquito bite and are similar to that of the common flu. They include fever, headache, chills and anaemia. In severe cases malaria can cause jaundice, seizures, coma and even death.</p>

Dengue virus is transmitted to humans through the bites of the female Aedes aegypti mosquito.</p>
                            <p class = "text text-sm">There are four serotypes of the dengue virus: DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3 and DENV-4. These serotypes are similar yet distinct from each another. The dengue viruses are members of the genus Flavivirus in the family Flaviviridae.
